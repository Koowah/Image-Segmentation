# Bi-class Bayesian image segmentation and denoising

## KMeans, MPM, Markov Random Fields

School project - will be cleaned up and formatted into useable modules as soon as time allows me to do it.

Doc will be updated to give proper directions to use programs and runtimes can be quite long (for MRFs in particular).

Report written in french (unfortunately !) will also be posted to help with interpretation.
